# Bob [^_^]
## A tragicomic chat bot

Bob used to be a lackadaisical teenager and was born in a Code Kata.
In conversation, his responses were limited:
* Bob answered "Sure." if you asked him a question.
* He answered "Whoa, chill out!" if you YELLED AT HIM.
* He answered "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!" if you yelled a question at him.
* He said "Fine. Be that way!" if you addressed him without actually saying anything.

Now Bob quotes from Samuel Beckettâ€™s [<em>Waiting for Godot</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot) in most of the cases.
