# Bob {^_^}
## A tragicomic chat bot

Bob used to be a lackadaisical teenager and was born in a Code Kata.
In conversation, his responses were limited:
* Bob answered 'Sure.' if you asked him a question.
* He answered 'Whoa, chill out!' if you YELLED AT HIM.
* He answered 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yelled a question at him.
* He said 'Fine. Be that way!' if you addressed him without actually saying anything.

Now Bob quotes from Samuel Beckettâ€™s 'Waiting for Godot' in most of the cases.
